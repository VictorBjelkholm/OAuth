#OAuth 1 PHP Library

Based on [Andy Smith's](http://term.ie/) [basic php library](http://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/code/php/) for OAuth.

Actually forked from [EHER's version](https://github.com/EHER/OAuth).

Tweaked to pass PSR-2.

Current status - Request token part seems to be working - nothing else properly tested yet.
